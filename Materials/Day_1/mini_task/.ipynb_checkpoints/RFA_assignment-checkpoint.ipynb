    "The first part of the assignment consists of two required tasks:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1)** Following Garcia and Norli (2012), extract state name counts from MD&As to assess geographic dispersion  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2)** Create a sentiment score for MD&As based on the Loughran and McDonald (2011) word lists  \n",

    "\n",
    "The second part of the assignment is an **optional** bonus task which enables you to earn extra points:  \n",

    "**Bonus task 3)** Combine task 1 and 2, evaluate the sentiment score relating to state name references\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Technical execution  (i.e. quality of your code)  \n",
    "2. Critical exploration  (i.e. degree to which you critically evaluate the quality of the output for research purposes) \n",

    "---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "**Note: regarding the `critical exploration` aspect it is very important that you show in the notebook that you are trying to verify your output and that you try to improve the quality of your output.**"
